QORA — Queue-Oriented Access

Development Plan, Purpose, and Emotional Narrative
(USTP Medical & Dental Clinic Hackathon — <30 Hours)

0. System Framing — Purpose & Philosophy

QORA stands for Queue-Oriented Access.

“Healthcare is not just about treatments, it’s about access, clarity, and dignity.”

Why QORA Exists

Many USTP students rely on free medical and dental services. Yet even with these benefits, accessing care can be stressful, confusing, and uncertain.

Manual scheduling wastes clinic staff time

Students feel anxious about slot availability

Free services risk being underutilized or unfairly distributed

QORA’s mission:

Automate clinic scheduling

Show real-time availability

Reduce stress and uncertainty

Protect privacy and dignity

Be AI-ready for future improvements

QORA is not just a system, it’s a bridge between people and care.

1. Sample Scenarios — Pitch Emotion
🎓 Student Scenario — Harry Inidal

Harry is a first-year student. He has no extra money for private clinics.
He remembers that the university provides free medical and dental services, but he hesitates.

He worries: “Will I get a slot? Will I have to wait for hours? What if the service is already taken?”

Anxiety builds, and he almost decides to skip care entirely.

Then, he opens QORA:

Uploads his Certificate of Registration → instantly verified

Sees the available slots for today’s services

Finds a slot that fits his schedule

Books it confidently, receiving a notification

Harry smiles, relieved — access is no longer uncertain, and he feels cared for before even stepping into the clinic.

🏥 Doctor / Clinic Scenario — Dr. Santos

Dr. Santos arrives at the clinic. She can see her available hours today.

Normally, she would spend hours creating manual schedules

Today, she opens QORA and simply sets her service type and capacity

The system automatically:

Generates slots

Publishes them to students

Tracks bookings in real-time

Updates if cancellations happen

Dr. Santos can focus on actual care, not administrative work.

QORA transforms the human experience for both students and staff.

2. Core Unique Selling Points (USPs)
A. Automation of Availability & Slots (Process Innovation)

Solves the inefficiency of manual schedule creation

Auto-generates slots based on doctor availability, service type, and capacity

Updates real-time availability for students

Allows emergency rescheduling
✅ Judges see operational efficiency as practical innovation

B. Human-Centered Design (Experience Innovation)

Shows exact slots, prevents overbooking

Enforces yearly service limits

Reduces frustration, uncertainty, and inequality
✅ Subjective innovation — emotional and human impact

C. Verification Flow (Access Control Innovation)

Students upload CoR → verified → access granted

Ensures fairness for limited free services

Maintains privacy and dignity
✅ Judges often overlook social design, but this is critical

D. Queue-Oriented Logic (Resource Management Innovation)

Slot decrement prevents overbooking

Prevents accidental scheduling conflicts

Can scale across multiple doctors and services
✅ Smart workflow innovation, low-tech but highly efficient

E. Static FAQ Page (Self-Service Innovation)

Reduces repetitive inquiries

Answers common student questions proactively

Adds value without increasing staff workload
✅ Judges recognize thoughtful user support as innovation

3. Framing “Innovation” in the Pitch

“QORA is innovative not because it uses AI, but because it rethinks how students and clinic staff interact. By automating schedules, reducing uncertainty, and providing clear access, we create an experience that is faster, fairer, and more humane.”

Optional addition:

“It’s a small, simple system — but it solves a real, human problem, where others only provide technology.”

If Panelists Ask: “Where is your innovation feature?”

Process Innovation: Automated availability, slot logic, queue control

Experience Innovation: Clarity, reduced stress, fairness for students

Scalable Design: Integrates with Clinic EZ, AI-ready for future

Judges see innovation as practical, scalable, and human-focused, not just flashy tech.

💡 Key Insight: Innovation = solving ignored real problems, not adding AI unnecessarily.

4. Technology Stack

Frontend: React Native + Expo

Backend: REST API

Database/Auth/Storage: Supabase (RLS, Auth, private file storage)

Version Control: GitHub

UI/UX: AI-assisted code (no Figma)

Security Principle:

Supabase Auth + Row Level Security + HTTPS + minimal data storage

5. Development Strategy

Rule:

Design → Static UI → Validate UX → Integrate Backend → Secure → Move to next interface

Each interface is completed end-to-end before moving on

Focus is not feature-heavy, but human-impact heavy
