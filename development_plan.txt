Below is a **clear, concise, and judge-ready explanation** of the **meaning, message, and purpose** of the system **Qora**, written so you can use it in **documentation, pitch, or Q&A** without sounding scripted.

---

## Meaning of the System (Qora)

**Qora** represents **clarity and order in public service queues**.

The system is designed to transform disorganized, manual, and time-consuming appointment processes into a **clear, structured, and predictable experience** for both citizens and service providers.

At its core, Qora is about **knowing your turn**—not guessing, waiting blindly, or wasting time.

---

## Meaning Behind the Name “Qora”

The name **Qora** is derived from **“Queue” + “Aura”**:

* **Q** → Queue (order, turn, fairness)
* **Aura** → A smooth, calm experience around public services

The name was intentionally kept:

* **Short** – easy to remember
* **Abstract** – adaptable to many public services
* **Neutral** – professional and non-intrusive

**Qora** does not sound technical or government-heavy, making it approachable for all users.

---

## Message of the System

The message Qora communicates is:

> **“Public services should respect people’s time.”**

Qora emphasizes that:

* Waiting should be **transparent**
